# Gofile Ruby

`gofile_ruby` is a simple, zero-dependency, developer friendly wrapper for the [GoFile API](https://gofile.io/api).

GoFile Ruby supports:

- Logging into an account with an API token.
- Retrieving a folder/file. *
- Updating folder/file details.
- Copying files/folders across folders. *
- Uploading files.
- Deleting files.

> **Warning**
>
> The endpoints for retrieving content details and copying content is only available to users with a GoFile Premium account.
> For this reason, testing for the aforementioned endpoints is minimal, and they might be unstable.
> If you wish to help this project improve, you can start by opening an issue [here](https://github.com/erayalkis/gofile_ruby/issues/new).
